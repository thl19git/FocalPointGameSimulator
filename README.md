This repository contains code for my Final Year Project, 'Social Construction in Focal Point Games'.

## Project Description
It has been argued that the role of conceptual resources (such as trust, norms, favours, institutions and `social capital' in general) in the shared construction of reality is to coordinate expectations; and the reason to coordinate expectations is to shortcut the complexity of decision-making in large scale (n-player, m-action) collective action situations. The aim of this project is to examine how a group of agents can learn, from first principles, how to find solutions to focal point games. A focal point game is one in which n players are presented with m choices, where all players have to opt for the same choice in order to receive the reward (otherwise they get 0), but all options have the same utility. In social dilemmas, it has been argued that some choices are more salient for other (psychological or cultural) reasons: consider choosing (without communication) a meeting point in London, given the following options: Karl Marx's grave in Highgate cemetery, the British Museum, Eros statue in Piccadilly circus, and the Dog and Duck pub in Peckham High Street. The aim is to design, implement and evaluate a self-organising multiagent system simulator to play focal point games, in which the agents *learn socially constructed* reasons for one option to be more salient than the others.
